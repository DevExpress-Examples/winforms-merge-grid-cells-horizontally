# Data Grid for Windows Forms - Emulate horizontal cell merge in GridView

[GridControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid) does not support horizontal cell merge out-of-the-box. This example creates a custom painter class to emulate the horizontal cell merge functionality in a [Grid View](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3464/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/views/grid-view).
